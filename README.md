# Finder README Milestone III

Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

## Project Aim 
We hope to make online shopping experiences better for consumers through a filtering application and to support local blogshop businesses.

## Problem & Motivation

When you hope to purchase a type of clothing and resort to finding it online, you often have multiple tabs open in your internet browser just to find that perfect piece of clothing. With multiple tabs in your browser,  your internet processing speed may slow down or you may be confused if you have looked at this website before.

Many have also realised after their purchase that there is a similar clothing that they wanted but at a cheaper price, but can only feel dejected as you have already made your payment for the more expensive item. Why is it so inconvenient to search for the type of clothing you want at the cheapest price from different shops? Also, there are definitely a group of consumers who are experiencing this problem, doing the exact same shopping process. So, why is there something that can ease the long and tedious shopping process so that people don’t have to do the same thing again?

## User Stories

1. As a budget-conscious shopper, I want to be able to purchase clothing within the price range that I set.
2. As a shopper with a hectic lifestyle who has little time for shopping, I hope to be able to search for the clothings that I want conveniently and efficiently.
3. As a shopper with a busy schedule, I wish to be able to save my favourite items somewhere so I can revisit and take a look at them more closely when I am more free.
4. As a blogshop owner or someone who sells clothes through online platforms, I want to attract potential customers by providing the best price and quality.

## How are we different from similar platforms?

Taobao - Taobao is a chinese online shopping website, headquartered in Hangzhou. Taobao facilitates the sale of goods from China. As this shopping platform emphasises on its cheap products, the product quality of their items may not be as good as expected. Also, Taobao sells a variety of items like furniture and accessories. Compared to Finder, we plan to be an online platform specifically to search for clothings, for shoppers who are looking for quality clothes from various Singapore blogshops. 

Shopee/Zalora - Shopee is a distributor of various marketplaces like Korea and China. They carry a range of products other than fashion apparel, such as home appliances, beauty and personal care, food and beverages and furniture. Zalora offers an extensive collection of international and local brands and designers. They carry thousands of products across men’s and women’s fashion apparel, shoes, accessories, and beauty categories. For Shopee and Zalora, customers are able to shop on the app itself and check out from the app. For our app Finder, we only focus on Singapore blogshops and their apparels. Purchasing the item will have to be done on the blogshop itself. Finder simply serves as a search engine for customers to search for their desired apparels carried by the various blogshops in Singapore.

Google Search Engine - By using the Google Search Engine, one can find almost anything that is related to the word searched for. This includes terms not related to fashion or clothing at all. However, for our application, we are specifically targeting the search for clothes and also enabling functions to compare prices or to filter the user’s preferences. Not only so, the Google Search Engine does not typically show clothes that are sold are local blogshops because some of the blogshops are smaller in scale, hence Finder provides a platform for shoppers who are interested in clothes sold by various local blogshops to shop.

## Scope of Project

The application serves as a one-stop platform that filters or sorts through the marketplace and displays a list of blogshops selling the particular item that the consumer searched for.

An application-based platform will share a common database with different blogshops based in Singapore and provide the same functionality with a traditional search engine. If one is in search of a type of clothing, he or she can input it in Finder’s search engine and a list of clothings that fulfill the user’s criteria will be displayed. This helps users to reduce their time spent on searching the same type of item in different blogshop websites. They will also be able to see all the results displayed in a single screen instead of using their effort to move between different windows.

The application has a user authentication feature to allow users to have their items saved in the account when switching devices or after logging out. Their user profiles are also customisable, where they can change their display name, email and password. Users can also delete their account if they do not wish to use it anymore.

The application has features that allows users to sort the results by price and alphabetical order. This enables users to be able to view clothes based on the sequence that they prefer. For example, if they are finding the cheapest clothes, they will be able to see the comparison of the prices from different blogshops clearly without having to keep changing tabs. This helps to make users’ shopping experience more convenient.

The application also has filtering features that allows users to input their brand preferences and budget range for a more precise and targeted search result. For shoppers who have budgets while they are shopping, this feature can benefit them as they are able to just view clothings from different blogshops that fit their budget. This can greatly reduce their time to filter the items in many other blogshop websites.

The application has a favourites feature whereby users can add items that they like to their favourites list for safekeeping purposes. They can also choose to remove it from the list if they do not like it anymore. This way, they can bookmark the items if they wish to view or purchase it another time.

## Expansion/Future Plans
| Feature | How it is meant to help: |
| --- | --- |
| Create a seller’s version of Finder | When sellers can create their own seller account, they will be able to upload their clothes onto Finder’s database to be shown to customers. This way, sellers can frequently do their update of stocks in Finder and shoppers will be able to see the latest clothes in stock. To differentiate Finder from apps like Carousell, there can be authorisation checks to make sure that sellers are authorised local blogshops in Singapore. |
| After shoppers click on an item, they can view details of that item before directing shoppers to the shop’s website | It helps shoppers know more about the clothes that they are interested in before going to the actual website to purchase it. | 
| Add sizes available to the clothes | This helps shoppers to find clothes of their size. |
| Filter by sizes function | This helps shoppers find clothes of their size. | 
| Filter by date function | This helps shoppers to shop for clothes based on how new they are. |
| Add reviews for individual items | This allows shoppers to leave reviews for individual items and allows sorting by popularity to help shoppers identify which are the more popular clothes right now. |
