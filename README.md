# Problem & Motivation

When you hope to purchase a type of clothing and resort to finding it online, you often have multiple tabs open in your internet browser just to find that perfect piece of clothing. With multiple tabs in your browser,  your internet processing speed may slow down or you may be confused if you have looked at this website before.

Many have also realised after their purchase that there is a similar clothing that they wanted but at a cheaper price, but can only feel dejected as you have already made your payment for the more expensive item. Why is it so inconvenient to search for the type of clothing you want at the cheapest price from different shops? Also, there are definitely a group of consumers who are experiencing this problem, doing the exact same shopping process. So, why is there something that can ease the long and tedious shopping process so that people donâ€™t have to do the same thing again?

# User Stories

1. As a budget-conscious shopper, I want to be able to purchase clothing within the price range that I set.
2. As a shopper with a hectic lifestyle who has little time for shopping, I hope to be able to search for the clothings that I want conveniently and efficiently.
3. As a shopper with a busy schedule, I wish to be able to save my favourite items somewhere so I can revisit and take a look at them more closely when I am more free.
4. As a blogshop owner or someone who sells clothes through online platforms, I want to attract potential customers by providing the best price and quality.
